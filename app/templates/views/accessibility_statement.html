  <h1 class="heading-large">Accessibility statement</h1>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This accessibility statement applies to the notifications.thecatalyst.org.uk domain. It does not apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#TODO">Catalyst Notify API documentation subdomain</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This website is run by the Catalyst Notify team at CAST. It is designed to be used by as many people as possible. You should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The text should be clear and simple to understand.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How accessible this website is</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>screen reader users may find the process of moving templates and folders confusing</li>
    <li>one page links to a PDF document that is not fully accessible</li>
    <li>the Notify status page has several accessibility issues</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We also know that the emails Notify sends are not fully accessible. The JAWS and NVDA screen readers announce extra spaces in emails when you view them in Microsoft Outlook.
