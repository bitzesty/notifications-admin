  <h3 class="heading-small">Protect sensitive information</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Some messages include sensitive information like security codes or password reset links.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re sending a message with sensitive information, you can choose to hide those details on the Notify dashboard once the message has been sent. This means that only the message recipient will be able to see that information.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">User permissions and signing in</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can set different user permissions in Notify. This lets you control who in your team has access to certain parts of the service.</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>your email address and password</li>
    <li>a text message code that Notify sends to your phone</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">If signing in with a text message is a problem for your team, <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="/support">contact us</a> to find out about using an email link instead.</p>
